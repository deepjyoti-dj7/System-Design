# üß© **Microservices Architecture**

---

## üìñ 1. Definition

> **Microservices Architecture** is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services ‚Äî each responsible for a specific business capability.

- Each **microservice** runs in its own process
- Communicates typically via lightweight protocols (HTTP/REST, gRPC, messaging)
- Built around **business capabilities** rather than technical layers

## üß± 2. Core Principles

| Principle                         | Description                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Responsibility**         | Each service owns a single business function                           |
| **Loose Coupling**                | Services interact via well-defined interfaces, minimizing dependencies |
| **Autonomy**                      | Services are independently deployable, scalable, and replaceable       |
| **Decentralized Data Management** | Each service manages its own database or data store                    |
| **Infrastructure Automation**     | Emphasis on CI/CD pipelines for deployment and scaling                 |

## üß¨ 3. Architecture Overview

```
+-------------------+     +-------------------+     +-------------------+
| Microservice A     |<--->| Microservice B     |<--->| Microservice C     |
| (User Service)     |     | (Order Service)    |     | (Payment Service)  |
+-------------------+     +-------------------+     +-------------------+
       |                        |                         |
    Database A               Database B                 Database C
```

- Services communicate via APIs (synchronous or asynchronous)
- Each service owns its **own data**, avoiding shared databases
- Service discovery and API gateways manage routing

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Communication Patterns

| Pattern          | Description                                          | Example Protocols           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Synchronous**  | Request-response style                               | HTTP/REST, gRPC             |
| **Asynchronous** | Messaging or event-driven, decouples sender/receiver | RabbitMQ, Kafka, MQTT       |
| **API Gateway**  | Single entry point routing requests to microservices | Kong, Zuul, AWS API Gateway |

## üèóÔ∏è 5. Data Management

| Strategy                 | Description                                   | Pros                                | Cons                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Database per service** | Each service has an isolated DB               | Loose coupling, independent scaling | Complex cross-service transactions |
| **Shared DB**            | Multiple services share one DB (anti-pattern) | Simpler for transactions            | Tight coupling, limits scalability |

---

## üîê 6. Security

- Authentication typically delegated to a centralized **Identity Provider** (OAuth2, OpenID Connect)
- API Gateway enforces **authorization, throttling, logging**
- Services validate all requests individually (Zero Trust)
