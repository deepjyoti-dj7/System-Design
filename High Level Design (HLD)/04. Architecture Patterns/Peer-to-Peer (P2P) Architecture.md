# üîó **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**

---

## üìñ 1. Definition

> **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture** is a decentralized network model where each participant (peer) acts as both a client and a server, sharing resources directly with other peers without relying on a centralized server.

- Each node in the network is equal in terms of functionality and responsibility.
- Peers communicate directly to share data, services, or computational resources.
- Commonly used for file sharing, blockchain networks, real-time communications, and distributed computing.

## üîê 5. Security Considerations

- **Authentication & Trust:**
  Peers are often anonymous; trust models, reputation systems, or cryptographic identities (PKI) are essential.
- **Data Integrity:**
  Use hashing (e.g., SHA-256) to verify shared data authenticity.
- **Encryption:**
  Secure peer communication via TLS or other encryption to prevent eavesdropping.
- **Sybil Attacks:**
  Prevent attackers from creating many fake identities to control the network.
- **Access Control:**
  Define who can join or access resources in permissioned P2P networks.

- **Bootstrapping:**
  Peers initially connect via known bootstrap nodes to discover others.

  Structured P2P uses routing tables (e.g., Kademlia‚Äôs XOR metric) to efficiently find peers.
- **Flooding & Gossip:**
  Unstructured P2P floods queries or uses gossip protocols to propagate info.
- **NAT Traversal:**
  Techniques like STUN, TURN help peers behind firewalls connect.
