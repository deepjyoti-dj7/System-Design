# ‚úÖ **APIs**

---

## üß© 1. What is an API?

**API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and mechanisms that allows different software components to communicate and exchange data. In essence, APIs define **how software interacts**.

> Think of an API as a **contract** between a client (consumer) and a server (provider), stating:
> ‚ÄúIf you send me this kind of request, I will respond with this kind of result.‚Äù

---

## üéØ 2. Why APIs Matter

APIs are:

- **Interfaces between components** in a microservices or service-oriented architecture.
- **Points of extensibility** for internal teams and third-party developers.
- **Communication protocols** over HTTP, TCP, WebSocket, or others.
- A critical part of systems that prioritize **decoupling, scalability, and modularity**.

## üß† 3. Core API Concepts

### 3.1 Endpoint

- The specific URL that represents a resource or action.
  E.g., `GET /users/123`

### 3.2 Methods/Verbs

- Common in HTTP-based APIs:

  - `GET`: Retrieve data
  - `POST`: Create new data
  - `PUT/PATCH`: Update data
  - `DELETE`: Remove data

### 3.3 Request/Response

- API exchanges are usually **request-response cycles**.

  - Request: Method + URL + Headers + Body
  - Response: Status code + Headers + Body

### 3.4 Resources

- In REST, everything is treated as a **resource**.
  E.g., `/users`, `/products`, `/orders`

### 3.5 Status Codes

- `200 OK`: Success
- `201 Created`
- `400 Bad Request`
- `401 Unauthorized`
- `404 Not Found`
- `500 Internal Server Error`

## üõ§Ô∏è 4. API Architectural Styles

### 4.1 REST (Representational State Transfer)

- Stateless
- Resource-oriented
- CRUD-based
- HTTP-native
- Common in public APIs (e.g., GitHub, Twitter)

**Pros**:

- Simple and intuitive
- Scalable
- Widely adopted

**Cons**:

- Over-fetching/under-fetching
- Verbose

---

### 4.2 GraphQL

- Developed by Facebook
- Client defines the shape of the response
- Single endpoint (`/graphql`)
- Schema and types enforced

**Pros**:

- Efficient data fetching
- Strong typing and introspection
- Great for frontend flexibility

**Cons**:

- Complex caching
- Requires learning curve
- Overhead in server parsing

---

### 4.3 gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

- Binary protocol based on HTTP/2
- Uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf)
- Fast, compact, efficient
- Suitable for microservices

**Pros**:

- High performance
- Strongly typed
- Built-in code generation

**Cons**:

- Harder to debug
- Not browser-friendly without proxies

---

### 4.4 WebSockets

- Full-duplex, bidirectional communication
- Used for real-time apps (chat, gaming, notifications)

---

## üì¶ 5. Types of APIs

| Type               | Description                                                  | Examples                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Internal APIs**  | Used within the organization for inter-service communication | Microservices                     |
| **External APIs**  | Exposed to third parties, often monetized                    | Stripe, Twilio, Google Maps       |
| **Partner APIs**   | Shared with specific external partners                       | Business-to-business integrations |
| **Composite APIs** | Aggregate multiple endpoints into one                        | Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)        |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6. API Design Principles

### 6.1 Consistency

- Use consistent naming, status codes, and response formats.
- Prefer **camelCase** or **snake_case** but don‚Äôt mix.

### 6.2 Versioning

- Use URI versioning (`/v1/users`)
- Or header-based (`Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json`)
- Never break existing consumers

### 6.3 Idempotency

- `GET`, `DELETE`, `PUT` should be idempotent.
- Repeating the request has the same effect.

### 6.4 Pagination, Filtering, Sorting

- Essential for scalability:

  - `?page=2&limit=50`
  - `?sort=name&order=asc`
  - `?filter=status:active`

### 6.5 HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State)

- Provides links to available actions within the response
- Rarely fully implemented, but conceptually important in REST

---

## üîê 7. API Security

### 7.1 Authentication

- **API Key**: Basic, static access token
- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorization framework (Google, Facebook APIs)
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Compact, self-contained auth tokens
- **Basic Auth**: Not recommended unless secured by TLS

### 7.2 Authorization

- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
- Scope-based access (in OAuth2)

### 7.3 Transport Security

- Enforce **HTTPS** only
- Protect against **man-in-the-middle attacks**

### 7.4 Rate Limiting and Throttling

- Prevent abuse and DoS
- Example headers:

  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`

---

## üìà 8. Scalability and Performance

### 8.1 Caching

- Use HTTP cache headers:

  - `ETag`, `Cache-Control`, `Last-Modified`

- Reverse proxies: **Varnish, Cloudflare, Fastly**

### 8.2 Asynchronous APIs

- Use **webhooks**, **event-driven architecture**, or **queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)** to decouple.

### 8.3 Load Balancing

- Horizontal scaling with HAProxy, NGINX, Envoy.
- Use **sticky sessions** if needed.

### 8.4 Rate Limiting

- Token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms
- Often implemented at API gateway (e.g., Kong, Apigee)

## üß™ 9. API Testing and Validation

### 9.1 Types of Tests

| Type                  | Purpose                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Unit tests**        | Verify internal business logic            |
| **Integration tests** | Validate full API stack with DB, auth     |
| **Contract tests**    | Ensure consumers and providers agree      |
| **Load tests**        | Test performance and stability under load |

### 9.2 Tools

- Postman, Insomnia (manual testing)
- Newman, REST Assured (automation)
- k6, JMeter (performance)

---

## üìã 10. Documentation and Developer Experience (DX)

### 10.1 OpenAPI / Swagger

- Machine-readable and human-readable API specification
- Auto-generates docs and SDKs

### 10.2 API Portals

- Centralized hub for API documentation, keys, test console
- Examples: **Stripe‚Äôs API Docs**, **Twilio Console**

### 10.3 Mock Servers

- Simulate behavior before real implementation
- Tools: **Stoplight, WireMock**

2. **Develop** ‚Üí Code the handlers, middlewares, business logic
3. **Test** ‚Üí Ensure it meets spec
4. **Deploy** ‚Üí CI/CD pipelines, canary releases
5. **Monitor** ‚Üí Logs, metrics, tracing
6. **Version / Retire** ‚Üí Deprecate old APIs gracefully

## üßØ 12. API Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern               | Why it's Bad                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Returning 200 for errors   | Misleads clients, violates HTTP semantics                                 |
| Ignoring versioning        | Leads to breaking changes in production                                   |
| Inconsistent naming        | Confuses API consumers                                                    |
| Overfetching/underfetching | Performance and usability issues                                          |
| Mixing responsibilities    | API should not mix multiple domains (e.g., orders and users in one route) |

---

## üß© 13. Real-World Examples

| Company         | Design Features                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stripe**      | Clean REST, great docs, clear error codes, webhooks      |
| **GitHub**      | REST and GraphQL support, strong consistency             |
| **Slack**       | Event-driven webhooks, real-time updates via WebSocket   |
| **Google APIs** | OAuth2-based auth, quota management, gRPC under the hood |

## üí° 14. Summary and Takeaways

- **APIs are foundational** to modern software architecture.
- Choose architectural style based on use case (REST for public, gRPC for internal microservices).
- **Security, versioning, scalability, and documentation** are first-class concerns.
- A well-designed API **acts like a product** ‚Äî not just a technical interface.
- Focus on **developer experience (DX)** to encourage adoption and reduce integration bugs.
