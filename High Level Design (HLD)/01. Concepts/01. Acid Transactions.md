# ‚úÖ **ACID Transactions**

---

## üß© 1. What are ACID Transactions?

**ACID** is an acronym that describes the key properties of reliable database transactions. Introduced in the 1980s by **Jim Gray**, ACID defines the **guarantees a database system must provide to ensure integrity, consistency, and correctness** of data in the presence of concurrency, crashes, and errors.

> **ACID** stands for:
>
> - **Atomicity**
> - **Consistency**
> - **Isolation**
> - **Durability**

These properties form the **cornerstone of transactional databases** such as PostgreSQL, MySQL (InnoDB), Oracle, and SQL Server.

## üéØ 2. Core ACID Properties Explained

### 2.1 ‚öõÔ∏è Atomicity

- **Definition**: A transaction is all-or-nothing. It either completes entirely or not at all.
- **Example**: In a bank transfer, debit from Account A and credit to Account B must both happen, or neither should.
- **Failure Cases**: Power outage, app crash, network failure.
- **Implementation Mechanisms**:

  - Undo logs
  - Write-ahead logging (WAL)
  - Savepoints and rollbacks

---

### 2.2 üìè Consistency

- **Definition**: A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining **invariants and constraints**.
- **Examples**:

  - Referential integrity
  - Check constraints (e.g., `balance ‚â• 0`)

- **Note**: Consistency in ACID is **different from the "C" in CAP Theorem**.
- **Responsibility**: Often shared between **database engine** and **application logic**.

---

### 2.3 üßç Isolation

- **Definition**: Concurrent transactions behave as if they were executed sequentially.
- **Goal**: Prevent race conditions, dirty reads, and other anomalies.
- **Implementation**:

  - Locking (2PL ‚Äì Two-Phase Locking)
  - Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)

- **Isolation Levels (SQL Standard)**:

  | Level            | Dirty Reads | Non-Repeatable Reads | Phantom Reads |
  | ---------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
  | Read Uncommitted | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ                   | ‚úÖ            |
  | Read Committed   | ‚ùå          | ‚úÖ                   | ‚úÖ            |
  | Repeatable Read  | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå                   | ‚úÖ            |
  | Serializable     | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå                   | ‚ùå            |

---

### 2.4 üíæ Durability

- **Definition**: Once a transaction is committed, it survives any system failure.
- **Ensures**: Data written to permanent storage (e.g., disk, SSD).
- **Mechanisms**:

  - Write-ahead logging (WAL)
  - Disk flush (fsync)
  - Database checkpoints

- **Failure Scenarios**:

  - Power outage
  - Crash before flush
  - Disk failures (often mitigated by RAID, replication)

## üß† 3. Theoretical Underpinnings

### 3.1 Transaction Theory (Serializability)

- **Serializability**: The gold standard of isolation.
- The outcome of executing transactions concurrently should be equivalent to some **serial execution** of the same transactions.

### 3.2 Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

- A distributed protocol for atomicity across multiple nodes.

- **Phases**:

  1. Prepare phase: All nodes agree they can commit.
  2. Commit phase: All nodes actually commit.

- **Drawbacks**: Blocking, slow recovery.

- Used in distributed SQL databases like CockroachDB, Spanner (modified with Paxos).

## üó∫Ô∏è 4. ACID in Architecture Design

### 4.1 ACID in Monolithic Systems

- Centralized RDBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle).
- Full ACID compliance out-of-the-box.
- Transactions often scoped to individual SQL commands or grouped within an application.

### 4.2 ACID in Distributed Systems

- **Harder to guarantee ACID** due to:

  - Network partitions
  - Node failures
  - Latency

- Options:

  - **Distributed ACID (NewSQL)**: Google Spanner, CockroachDB.
  - **Application-Managed ACID**: Using transactional message queues + DB + retries.

## üõ†Ô∏è 5. Real-World Implementation Techniques

### 5.1 Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)

- Logs changes before applying them to disk.
- Used to recover after crash.
- Example: PostgreSQL, InnoDB.

### 5.2 Checkpointing

- Periodic snapshotting of database state.
- Reduces log replay time on restart.

### 5.3 Locking Protocols

- **Pessimistic Concurrency**: Lock rows/tables before updates.
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Assume no conflict, validate at commit (e.g., version numbers).

### 5.4 Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)

- Readers don‚Äôt block writers and vice versa.
- Readers see a consistent snapshot of data.
- Used by: PostgreSQL, Oracle, CockroachDB.

## üîÑ 6. ACID vs BASE

| Feature      | ACID                          | BASE                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Focus        | Consistency, correctness      | Availability, scalability      |
| Consistency  | Strong                        | Eventual                       |
| Availability | May sacrifice for consistency | High                           |
| Use Case     | Banking, inventory, financial | Caching, social networks, IoT  |
| Examples     | PostgreSQL, MySQL (InnoDB)    | Cassandra, DynamoDB, Couchbase |

## üß™ 7. Testing and Validating Transactions

### 7.1 ACID Test Scenarios

| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Power failure                   | WAL + fsync + battery-backed cache        |
| App crashes mid-transaction     | Atomic commit + undo logs                 |
| Simultaneous writes             | Row-level locks, versioning (MVCC)        |

## üîß 10. Design Patterns Leveraging ACID

| Pattern                               | Description                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transactional Outbox**              | Store events inside the same transaction as the DB write. |
| **Sagas (Compensating Transactions)** | Sequence of local transactions with undo logic.           |
| **Unit of Work**                      | Aggregate all operations under a single transaction.      |

## üí° 11. Summary and Takeaways

- ACID ensures **data integrity, correctness, and recoverability**.
- Not always necessary‚Äîuse only where **strong consistency and integrity are essential**.
- ACID comes at a cost: performance, complexity, and scalability.
- In distributed systems, **blending ACID with availability** is hard but possible with advanced techniques (e.g., Spanner, Raft, 2PC).
- The right **transaction strategy depends on business needs**, data sensitivity, and fault tolerance requirements.
