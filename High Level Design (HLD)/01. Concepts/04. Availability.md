# ✅ **Availability**

---

## 🧩 1. What is Availability?

**Availability** is a **measure of a system’s ability to remain operational and accessible when required for use**. It answers the question:

> “**Is the system there when I need it?**”

Mathematically:

$$
\text{Availability (A)} = \frac{\text{Uptime}}{\text{Uptime} + \text{Downtime}}
$$

It is usually expressed as a percentage, e.g., 99.9%, also known as **“three nines”** availability.

## 🎯 2. Key Metrics and Terminology

### 2.1 **Uptime**

- Time system is fully functional and available.

### 2.2 **Downtime**

- Time system is not operational.
- Includes maintenance, failure, outages, etc.

### 2.3 **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**

- Average time between two consecutive failures.
- Higher MTBF = Better reliability.

### 2.4 **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)**

- Time taken to restore a system after a failure.
- Lower MTTR = Faster recovery = Higher availability.

### 2.5 **Availability Formula (MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR))**

## 📊 3. Nines of Availability

| Availability         | Downtime per year | Downtime per week |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 99% (two nines)      | \~3.65 days       | \~1.68 hours      |
| 99.9% (three nines)  | \~8.76 hours      | \~10.1 minutes    |
| 99.99% (four nines)  | \~52.6 minutes    | \~1.01 minutes    |
| 99.999% (five nines) | \~5.26 minutes    | \~6 seconds       |

Achieving more “nines” is **exponentially harder** and costlier.

## 🛠️ 4. Design Principles to Achieve High Availability (HA)

### 4.1 **Redundancy**

- **Goal**: Avoid single points of failure (SPOF).
- Use replicated services (load-balanced frontends, clustered databases).
- **Example**: Active-Active, Active-Passive failover models.

### 4.2 **Failover and Replication**

- **Automatic failover** to standby systems during failure.
- **Replication** ensures data is copied across systems.
- **Types**:

  - Synchronous (strong consistency)
  - Asynchronous (eventual consistency)

### 4.3 **Load Balancing**

- Distributes traffic across servers.
- **Techniques**: Round-robin, weighted, least-connections.
- Helps **scale reads**, spread load, and improve **tolerance to node failure**.

### 4.4 **Health Checks and Monitoring**

- Continuously probe system components.
- **Self-healing** mechanisms restart or reroute traffic.

### 4.5 **Isolation and Containment**

- Design systems as **microservices** or **modules**.
- Prevent failures in one component from affecting others.
- **Circuit Breakers**, **Bulkheads** are isolation patterns.

## 🧠 5. Theoretical Foundations

### 5.1 **CAP Theorem**

- **Consistency**, **Availability**, **Partition Tolerance** — pick 2.
- In distributed systems:

  - For high availability, often sacrifice **consistency** (AP systems like Cassandra).

### 5.2 **Fallacies of Distributed Computing**

1. The network is reliable.
2. Latency is zero.
3. Bandwidth is infinite.
4. The network is secure.
5. Topology doesn’t change.
6. There is one administrator.
7. Transport cost is zero.
8. The network is homogeneous.

All these affect **availability planning**.

### 5.3 **Brewer’s Theorem (Eventual Consistency)**

- Trade-offs made in AP systems.
- For example, Amazon Dynamo provides eventual consistency for availability.

## 🗺️ 6. Architectural Patterns for High Availability

### 6.1 **N-Tier Architecture**

- Split into presentation, application, and data layers.
- Redundancy and load balancing at each layer.

### 6.2 **Microservices**

- Small, independently deployable services.
- Each service can scale and fail independently.
- Improves fault isolation.

### 6.3 **Event-Driven Architecture**

- Async communication via message queues.
- Reduces coupling and increases resilience.

### 6.4 **Geo-Distributed Systems**

- Multi-region deployment for disaster resilience.
- Improves availability across geographies.

## 🔁 7. Data Availability Techniques

### 7.1 **Replication**

- Master-slave, multi-master, quorum-based systems.
- Example: MongoDB replica sets, Cassandra.

### 7.2 **Sharding**

- Horizontal partitioning for scalability.
- Needs consistent hashing to handle node changes.

### 7.3 **Eventual Consistency**

- Accept stale reads for better availability.
- Use in **AP systems** (e.g., DynamoDB, Cassandra).

## 🔒 8. Availability and Resilience Strategies

### 8.1 **Chaos Engineering**

- Intentionally break components (Netflix Chaos Monkey).
- Ensures system survives real-world failures.

### 8.2 **Backpressure and Throttling**

- Prevent overload and maintain system responsiveness.

### 8.3 **Retries with Exponential Backoff**

- Helps transient failure recovery without overwhelming systems.

### 8.4 **Rate Limiting**

- Protect services under sudden high load.

---

## 🧪 9. Testing for High Availability

### 9.1 **Fault Injection Testing**

- Induce random failures to observe system behavior.

### 9.2 **Disaster Recovery (DR) Drills**

- Practice failover to backup regions or systems.

### 9.3 **Load Testing**

- Stress test the system for performance bottlenecks.

## 🧮 10. Cost vs Availability Trade-off

- **Each additional "9" adds exponential cost.**
- Balance:

  - Business SLA requirements
  - Cost of downtime
  - Complexity and maintenance burden

## 🔚 Summary

High availability is not a single decision — it’s a **system-wide discipline** encompassing:

- Redundancy & replication
- Failure handling
- Data durability
- Monitoring & alerting
- Testing & automation

Designing for availability requires **clear SLAs**, **fault-tolerance thinking**, and **continuous evaluation** of trade-offs between **cost, complexity, and business needs**.
