# üõ°Ô∏è **Disaster Recovery**

## üß≠ 1. Introduction

Disaster Recovery (DR) is a critical discipline within the broader domain of reliability and business continuity. As systems grow in complexity and scale, so do the risks of partial or total failures, whether due to natural disasters, human error, malicious activity, or infrastructure outages. A well-designed disaster recovery plan ensures that systems can **resume operations with minimal disruption** and **acceptable data loss (RPO)** and **recovery time (RTO)**.

This document explores the theory, patterns, and technologies behind Disaster Recovery in distributed systems, offering guidance suitable for building robust recovery architectures.

## üîç 2. What is Disaster Recovery?

Disaster Recovery refers to the strategy, policies, and procedures that enable the restoration of IT services after a disruptive event. This includes restoring application functionality, data integrity, user access, and operational continuity.

### 2.1 Key Objectives

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: The maximum acceptable time to restore service.
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.

### 2.2 Types of Disasters

- **Natural**: Earthquakes, floods, fires
- **Technical**: Hardware failure, data corruption, software bugs
- **Human-caused**: Operator error, malicious insider, cyberattacks
- **Third-party failures**: ISP outage, cloud provider region unavailability

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Core Components of DR Architecture

### 3.1 Backup Systems

- Full, incremental, and differential backups
- Object storage for cold backups (e.g., Amazon S3 Glacier)
- Database-native backup mechanisms (e.g., MySQL dumps, pg_dump)

### 3.2 Redundant Infrastructure

- Active-Passive and Active-Active deployments
- Multi-region, multi-cloud support
- Load balancers, DNS failover

### 3.3 Monitoring & Alerting

- Heartbeat checks
- SLA/SLO compliance metrics
- Integration with incident response tools (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)

### 3.4 DR Automation

- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scripts for rapid environment rebuild
- Automated failover and rollback
- Playbooks for recovery actions

## üåê 4. DR Strategies

### 4.1 Backup and Restore (Cold DR)

**Description**: Periodic backups stored offsite. On disaster, restore manually.

**Pros**:

- Low cost
- Simple to implement

**Cons**:

- High RTO and RPO
- Manual restore may take hours or days

### 4.2 Pilot Light

**Description**: Core systems are always running at minimal scale; scaled up during disaster.

**Pros**:

- Faster recovery than cold DR
- Lower cost than active systems

**Cons**:

- Requires careful orchestration
- More expensive than backups

### 4.3 Warm Standby

**Description**: A scaled-down but fully functional replica is kept live.

**Pros**:

- Near real-time data replication
- Faster RTO

**Cons**:

- Higher operational costs
- Synchronization complexity

### 4.4 Hot Standby / Active-Active

**Description**: Fully live system in multiple locations handling traffic.

**Pros**:

- Minimal RTO/RPO
- Load balancing improves performance

**Cons**:

- High complexity
- Expensive to maintain

## üß† 5. DR Design Considerations

### 5.1 Data Consistency

- Use eventual vs strong consistency depending on workload
- Employ write-ahead logging and multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)

### 5.2 Networking & DNS

- Use Anycast IP or DNS failover for redirection
- Low TTL values to speed up propagation

### 5.3 Dependency Mapping

- Know all dependencies (DNS, auth, storage, 3rd party APIs)
- Test cascading failures

### 5.4 Automation

- IaC tools: Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CloudFormation
- CI/CD integration for automated DR validation

---

## üîê 6. Security & Compliance

### 6.1 Data Encryption

- At-rest and in-transit
- Key management with KMS/HSM

### 6.2 Compliance Frameworks

- ISO 27001, SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR
- Regular audits and disaster simulations

### 6.3 Access Control

- Principle of least privilege
- MFA for administrative access

---

## üìä 7. DR Testing and Validation

### 7.1 Tabletop Exercises

- Role-play scenarios with all stakeholders

### 7.2 Chaos Engineering

- Inject controlled failures (e.g., using Chaos Monkey)
- Validate system behavior and recovery paths

### 7.3 Automated Failover Testing

- Scheduled switchover drills
- Monitor RTO and RPO metrics

### 7.4 Continuous Audit

- Maintain up-to-date runbooks
- Use monitoring to detect configuration drifts

---

## üõ† 8. Tools and Technologies

### Cloud-Native

- AWS Route53, RDS Multi-AZ, S3 Cross-Region Replication
- Azure Site Recovery, GCP Persistent Disk Snapshots

### Backup Tools

- Veeam, Rubrik, Bacula, Velero
- Native DB tools (mysqldump, pgBackRest)

### DR Orchestration

- CloudEndure (AWS), Zerto, Druva
- Custom scripts via Ansible, Python, or Bash

### Monitoring & Alerting

- Prometheus + Alertmanager
- Datadog, Grafana, Splunk

## üßæ 9. Summary & Best Practices

- Design with failure in mind ‚Äî assume every component can and will fail
- Choose DR strategy based on criticality and budget
- Regularly test and update DR plans
- Keep documentation and contacts updated
- Monitor SLAs and automate recovery
- Train teams with real-world simulations

Disaster recovery is a **culture**, not just a feature. Preparedness is not accidental ‚Äî it is built, maintained, and continuously improved.
