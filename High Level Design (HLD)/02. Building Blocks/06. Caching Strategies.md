# 🧠 **Caching Strategies**

Caching is not just about storing data—**how you read from and write to the cache** (i.e., your strategy) determines system performance, data freshness, and reliability.

Caching strategies define the **interaction pattern between your cache, the application, and the data store** (usually a database or backend API).

## 🗂️ Common Caching Strategies

| Strategy                 | Reads from  | Writes to           | Common Use Case       |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Cache-Aside              | App         | App → Cache & DB    | Most widely used      |
| Read-Through             | App → Cache | Cache → DB fallback | Transparent reads     |
| Write-Through            | App         | Cache + DB (sync)   | Strong consistency    |
| Write-Behind (Backplane) | App         | Cache (async DB)    | High write throughput |
| Refresh-Ahead            | App         | Cache + Preload     | Prevents stale cache  |

## 1. 🧾 **Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)**

### 📖 What It Is:

The **application code** is responsible for checking the cache and loading from the DB on a miss. Also known as **lazy caching**.

### 🛠 How It Works:

```
1. Check cache
2. If miss → fetch from DB
3. Save in cache
4. Return result
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Simple, app-controlled
- Avoids stale data (if TTL is short)

### ⚠️ Cons:

- First access is **slow**
- Cache **miss stampedes** possible

### 🔧 Example (Python + Redis):

```python
def get_user(user_id):
    if (val := redis.get(f"user:{user_id}")):
        return json.loads(val)

    user = db.fetch_user(user_id)
    redis.setex(f"user:{user_id}", 300, json.dumps(user))
    return user
```

## 2. 📖 **Read-Through Cache**

### 📖 What It Is:

The **cache itself handles loading from DB** on a miss. The app talks only to the cache.

### 🛠 How It Works:

```
App → Cache → (miss) → Cache loads from DB → Return
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Clean app logic
- Cache always manages itself

### ⚠️ Cons:

- Needs custom cache layer (or lib support)
- Harder to debug

### 📦 Example Use Case:

Used in systems like **Ehcache, Spring Cache**, or **Amazon DAX (for DynamoDB)**.

---

## 3. 📝 **Write-Through Cache**

### 📖 What It Is:

All writes go **through the cache**, which then writes to the DB synchronously.

### 🛠 How It Works:

```
App → Write to Cache → Cache writes to DB
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Cache and DB always in sync
- Prevents stale reads

### ⚠️ Cons:

- **Write latency increases** due to sync DB operation
- Writes fail if DB is down

### 🔧 Example (Pseudo):

```python
def write_user(user_id, data):
    db.update_user(user_id, data)
    cache.set(f"user:{user_id}", json.dumps(data))
```

---

## 4. 🕓 **Write-Behind / Write-Back Cache**

### 📖 What It Is:

App writes to **cache only**, and the cache updates the DB asynchronously (in the background).

### 🛠 How It Works:

```
App → Cache → (later) → Cache writes to DB
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Super fast writes
- Batches writes for efficiency

### ⚠️ Cons:

- Risk of **data loss** if cache crashes before flushing
- Complex failure handling

### 📦 Example Use Case:

Used in **high-throughput systems** where DB is a bottleneck (e.g., logging, analytics, counters).

---

## 5. 🔁 **Refresh-Ahead / Preemptive Refresh**

### 📖 What It Is:

Before cached data expires, the cache **refreshes it in the background**, avoiding sudden spikes on TTL expiry.

### 🛠 How It Works:

```
TTL set at 5 min → Refresh triggered at 4.5 min
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Avoids **cache stampedes**
- Guarantees fresh data

### ⚠️ Cons:

- Needs active monitoring
- May refresh unused entries

### 📦 Example:

Used by **Netflix and Google**, especially for **personalized content**, models, and feed generation.

## 🚨 Special Topic: Cache Stampede

### 📖 What It Is:

When **many requests simultaneously** hit an expired key, all of them fall back to DB at once.

### 🛠 Prevention Techniques:

- Use **Mutex/Locks** (e.g., Redis SETNX) to let only one recompute
- Implement **refresh-ahead**
- Add **randomized TTL** (`ttl + random(0,10)`)

## 📚 Real-World Use Cases

| Company      | Strategy Used            | Use Case                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Twitter**  | Cache-aside              | Timeline, trends              |
| **Facebook** | Write-through + Memcache | User profile, friend graph    |
| **Amazon**   | Read-through + TTL       | Product pages, pricing        |

## 🧪 Sample Redis TTL Strategy (Node.js)

```js
const redis = require("redis");
const client = redis.createClient();

async function getProduct(id) {
  const cacheKey = `product:${id}`;
  const cached = await client.get(cacheKey);

  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

  const data = await db.getProduct(id);
  await client.setEx(cacheKey, 600, JSON.stringify(data)); // TTL = 10 mins
  return data;
}
```

---

## 📑 Final Takeaways

- **Caching strategy = cache access pattern + data lifecycle logic**.
- Use **Cache-aside** for flexibility, **Write-through** for safety, and **Write-behind** for performance.
- Always plan for **expiration, eviction**, and **fallback** behavior.
- Use monitoring (hit rate, TTL, latency) to tune strategies in production.
- Combine strategies! e.g., Cache-aside for reads, Write-behind for writes.
