## üìò Cross-Cutting Concepts

### A. CAP & PACELC Theorems

- **CAP**: trade-off between Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance.
- **PACELC**: Extended: Else Latency vs Consistency matters outside partitions.

Databases vary:

- RDBMS: CP
- NoSQL key-value: AP
- NewSQL: aim for CA with coordination.

---

### B. ACID vs BASE

- **ACID**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
- **BASE**: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency.
  NoSQL often adopt BASE, RDBMS strictly ACID, NewSQL attempts both.

---

### C. Storage Engines

- Row-oriented vs column-oriented vs LSM vs B-Tree vs document vs graph vs in-memory hashed.
- Engine choice influences I/O patterns, latency, throughput.

---

### D. Replication & Partitioning

- Master‚Äëslave, multi‚Äëmaster, leaderless replication.
- Partitioning: hash, range, list, composite keys.
- Impacts consistency, failover, query patterns.

---

## ‚ö° Summary & Choosing the Right Fit

1. **Define Requirements:**
   üî∑ Data shape (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)
   üî∑ Query needs (transactions, analytics, graph, text)
   üî∑ Scale + performance (reads/writes volume)

   üî∑ Operational constraints (budget, team skills, compliance)

2. **Match DB Type to Need:**

   - Structured + transactions ‚Üí RDBMS/NewSQL
   - Massive key-value throughput ‚Üí Key-value

3. **Architect for Scale:**

   - Use caching (e.g., Redis) in front.
   - Shard or partition large datasets.
   - Replicate for read scaling and HA.
   - Consider multi-region for latency/fault tolerance.

4. **Use Hybrid Approaches:**

   - Polyglot persistence: mix DB types per component.
   - Or go multimodel / distributed SQL to reduce complexity.

---

### üîö Final Takeaways

- There's no one-size-fits-all DB.
- Every type optimizes certain trade-offs: schema flexibility, consistency, latency, scalability, complexity.
- Modern architectures often combine multiple types to meet business goals.
- As systems scale, complexity grows; choose wisely early and revisit as usage evolves.
