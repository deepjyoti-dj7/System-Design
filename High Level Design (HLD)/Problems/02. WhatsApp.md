# üí¨ WhatsApp System Design ‚Äì High-Level Design (HLD) with Data Estimations

This document outlines the high-level architecture of a messaging platform like **WhatsApp**, including both functional components and real-world system estimations. This is ideal for system design interviews or blueprinting large-scale messaging applications.

---

## üìå Functional Requirements

- One-to-one messaging
- Group messaging (up to 1024 users)
- Media sharing (images, videos, docs)
- Voice & video calling
- Real-time delivery status (sent, delivered, seen)
- End-to-end encryption (E2EE)
- Message syncing across devices (for multi-device support)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements

- High availability & durability
- Real-time low-latency messaging
- Horizontally scalable
- Security & privacy (E2EE, metadata protection)
- Fault tolerance and message reliability
- Push notifications
- Battery efficiency on mobile

## üß† System Components Overview

### 1. **Client Layer**

- iOS, Android, Desktop (Electron/Web)
- Caches recent messages
- Encrypts/decrypts content locally

### 2. **API Gateway**

- Handles client API requests
- Token-based authentication
- Validates message structure, rate limits

### 3. **Microservices (Back-End Services)**

| Service              | Purpose                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Registration Service | User verification via phone number + OTP                   |
| Messaging Service    | Message queuing, delivery, and retry logic                 |
| Media Service        | Uploading and delivering media (images, videos, documents) |
| Notification Service | Push notifications (APNs/FCM)                              |
| Presence Service     | Online/offline status, last seen                           |
| Sync Service         | Multi-device message consistency                           |
| Encryption Service   | Manages key distribution (without storing actual keys)     |

## üìä Estimated Data Metrics

### üë• User Base

- Monthly Active Users: **2B+**
- Concurrent active users (peak): \~1% = **20M**

### üí¨ Messaging

- Avg messages/user/day: 50
- Total messages/day: 2B √ó 50 = **100B**
- Peak messages per second: \~1.2M
- Avg message size (text): 512 bytes
- Daily message volume: 100B √ó 0.5KB = **\~50TB/day**

### üñº Media Uploads

- % of users sending media daily: 30% ‚Üí 600M
- Avg media size: 1.5MB
- Total daily media: 600M √ó 1.5MB = **\~900TB/day**
- CDN cache hit ratio: 90% for recent views

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Storage Strategy

| Component     | Storage Type      | Technology Example  |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| User Info     | Relational DB     | PostgreSQL, MySQL   |
| Messages      | Wide Column Store | Cassandra, ScyllaDB |
| Media Files   | Object Storage    | Amazon S3, GCS      |
| Presence Data | In-memory store   | Redis, DynamoDB TTL |
| Notifications | Event Queue       | Kafka, RabbitMQ     |
| Search (chat) | Full-text search  | Elasticsearch       |

---

## üöÄ Data Flow: Send Message

sequenceDiagram
Client->>API Gateway: Encrypted message request
API Gateway->>Messaging Service: Validate & forward
Messaging Service->>DB (Cassandra): Persist message
Messaging Service->>Notification Service: Push to receiver
Notification Service-->>Client: Push via FCM/APNs
Client->>Messaging Service: Acknowledgement

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è Content Delivery Optimization

- **Media CDN (CloudFront, Akamai)** serves downloaded media
- Media URLs are time-limited & encrypted
- Cold media pulled from S3; hot media cached on CDN
- Avoids re-upload of duplicate files via content hashing (SHA256)

---

## üß† End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

- **Signal Protocol** (double ratchet, prekeys)
- Message keys change every message (forward secrecy)
- **No message content stored on servers**
- Keys generated and stored _only_ on client devices

### Key Management:

- Pre-key bundles fetched during initial contact
- Encrypted media is uploaded; decryption key is sent in the message
- Encrypted call setup via SRTP + ZRTP

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Caching Strategy

| Item                | Tool      | TTL        |
| ------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Online status       | Redis     | 5 minutes  |
| Session tokens      | Redis     | 30 minutes |
| Delivery receipts   | In-Memory | Immediate  |
| Recent chat threads | Redis     | 24 hours   |

- Reduces lookup latency to <50ms
- Ensures snappy UX on app launch

---

## üìà Scalability & Availability

- Kafka queues for message routing & retries
- **Message IDempotency** to avoid duplicates
- **Sharded Cassandra** stores message logs (by user or chat thread)
- **Media stored in S3**, served by CDN
- Multi-AZ & region redundancy

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

- All messages/media: Encrypted end-to-end
- HTTPS for all network requests
- Key transparency/logging (future)
- No content stored server-side
- Metadata minimization (no chat graph inference)
- Privacy Labels on App Store

---

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

| Metric               | Tool                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Message delivery lag | Prometheus + Grafana   |
| Media load failures  | ELK Stack / Datadog    |
| Abuse/Spam tracking  | Custom + ML            |
| System health        | OpenTelemetry + Sentry |
