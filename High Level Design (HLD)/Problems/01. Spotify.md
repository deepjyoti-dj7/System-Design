## üß† System Components Overview

### 1. **Client Layer**

- Platforms: Mobile (iOS, Android), Web, Desktop
- Performs local caching (offline listening)
- Sends requests to API Gateway for playback and data

### 2. **API Gateway**

- Single entry point for clients
- Handles authentication, rate limiting
- Forwards requests to relevant microservices

### 3. **Microservices (Back-End Services)**

| Service               | Purpose                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User Service          | Handles user info, login, subscription tier (Free/Premium)     |
| Catalog Service       | Stores metadata: song title, artist, album, genre              |
| Search Service        | Elasticsearch-based full-text and fuzzy search                 |
| Playlist Service      | CRUD operations for user-created playlists                     |
| Streaming Service     | Handles actual audio streaming using bitrate adaptation        |
| Recommendation Engine | Suggests music based on listening history and user preferences |
| Ad Service            | Delivers targeted ads to Free users                            |

## üìä Estimated Data Metrics

### üë§ User Base

- Total active users: **500M**
- Peak concurrent users: ~2% ‚Üí **10M users**

### üé∂ Songs Catalog

- Total songs: **100M**
- Avg file size: 3MB (128kbps bitrate)
- Storage required: 100M √ó 3MB = **~300TB**
- CDN Cache (Top 10% of songs): 10M √ó 3MB = **~30TB**

### üîÑ Daily Usage

- Avg streams per user/day: 40
- Total daily streams: 500M √ó 40 = **20B**
- Peak streams per second: ~4M
- Bandwidth per stream: ~128kbps = 16KB/s
- Total bandwidth: 4M √ó 16KB/s = **~64 GB/s**

### üîç Search Volume

- Avg searches per user/day: 5
- Total search queries: 500M √ó 5 = **2.5B/day**
- Index size: ~300GB (based on song metadata)

### üìÅ Playlist System

- Avg playlists per user: 20
- Total playlists: 500M √ó 20 = **10B**
- Avg playlist size: 30 songs

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Storage Strategy

| Component       | Storage Type   | Technology Example        |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| User Data       | Relational DB  | PostgreSQL, Amazon Aurora |
| Music Metadata  | Document Store | MongoDB, DynamoDB         |
| Playlists       | Relational DB  | MySQL, Aurora             |
| Audio Files     | Object Storage | Amazon S3, Google Cloud   |
| Search Index    | Search Engine  | Elasticsearch             |
| Caching         | In-memory      | Redis / Memcached         |
| Recommendations | Data Lake + DB | Amazon S3 + Cassandra     |

## üöÄ Data Flow: Play a Song

sequenceDiagram
Client->>API Gateway: Request song playback
API Gateway->>Auth Service: Validate token
API Gateway->>Catalog Service: Fetch song metadata
API Gateway->>Streaming Service: Stream request
Streaming Service->>CDN/S3: Fetch audio file
Streaming Service-->>Client: Start streaming
Streaming Service->>Kafka: Log event
Kafka->>Analytics/Recommendations: Log analysis

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è Content Delivery Optimization

- **CDNs** (CloudFront, Akamai) serve top songs (10‚Äì20%) with edge caching
- Result: \~90% of all playback requests are served from CDN
- **Fallback to S3** for cold content
- Reduces global latency to <300ms for most users

---

## üß† Recommendation Engine

- Batch training: Spark ML (daily jobs)
- Real-time scoring: Kafka Streams + ML models
- Features include:

  - Genre preference
  - Listening time (e.g. Lo-Fi at night)
  - Skips, replays, likes

### Example:

- If a user listens to K-pop 60% of the time ‚Üí recommendations skew toward that
- A model may consider `likes + replays - skips` as an affinity score

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Caching Strategy

| Item                     | Tool      | TTL          |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| Metadata (hot songs)     | Redis     | 1‚Äì2 hours    |
| User sessions/tokens     | Memcached | 30 minutes   |
| Trending searches        | Redis     | 5‚Äì10 minutes |
| Playback state (last 10) | Redis     | 24 hours     |

Benefits:

- Reduces DB read load by >70%
- Speeds up search/autocomplete to \~50ms

---

## üìà Scalability & Availability

- **Microservices** deployed on Kubernetes (auto-scaling)
- **CDN** for static file distribution
- **Kafka** decouples services (e.g. logs, events)
- **Sharded DBs** to split user data across partitions
- **Failover replicas** to handle outages

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

- OAuth 2.0 with Google/Facebook login
- HTTPS for all requests
- Encrypted audio for Premium (DRM)
- GDPR + CCPA compliance
- Token-based auth with device fingerprinting

---

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

| Metric             | Tool                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Stream Errors      | Prometheus + Grafana |
| Request Latency    | ELK Stack / Datadog  |
| User Behavior Logs | Kafka + S3           |
| A/B Test Analysis  | Redshift / BigQuery  |
