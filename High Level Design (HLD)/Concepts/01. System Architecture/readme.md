# System Architecture

## Overview

System Architecture is one of the key aspects of High-Level Design (HLD). It defines the overall structure of a system and the interactions between its components. A good system architecture balances between scalability, performance, maintainability, and security.

## Key Types of System Architecture

### 1. **Monolithic Architecture**

In a **monolithic architecture**, all the components of the system are tightly integrated and run as a single service. These systems are easier to develop initially but can become difficult to scale and maintain as they grow.

- **Characteristics:**
  - All code exists in a single repository.
  - Tight coupling between components.
  - Harder to scale due to shared resources.
- **When to Use:**

  - Small-scale applications with limited resources.
  - Rapid development or MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stages.

- **Example:**
  - A simple blog or e-commerce site where all components like user authentication, product listing, and checkout are part of the same codebase.

### 2. **Microservices Architecture**

**Microservices architecture** breaks down a system into a collection of small, independent services that communicate over the network. Each microservice is responsible for a specific functionality of the system and can be deployed independently.

- **Characteristics:**

  - Each service has its own database.
  - Independent deployability.
  - Can be developed using different technologies.
  - Can scale each service independently.

- **When to Use:**

  - Large-scale systems with complex requirements.
  - Need for high availability and scalability.
  - Teams working on different services independently.

- **Example:**
  - A large e-commerce platform where payment, catalog, user management, and order management are separate services.

### 3. **Layered Architecture**

In **layered architecture**, the system is divided into layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application. The most common layers are:

- **Presentation Layer**: User interface (UI).
- **Service Layer**: Business logic.
- **Data Access Layer (DAO)**: Communication with databases.

- **Characteristics:**

  - Separation of concerns.
  - Easier to test and maintain.
  - Clear boundaries for development teams.

- **When to Use:**

  - When you want clear separation of responsibilities.
  - Applications where maintainability is a high concern.

- **Example:**
  - A traditional web application with distinct boundaries between user interface, logic, and database interaction.

### 4. **Event-Driven Architecture**

In an **event-driven architecture**, components of the system communicate through events, where an event is a change in state or an action that triggers a response in the system.

- **Characteristics:**
  - Uses message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
  - Decouples services from each other.
  - Can handle high volumes of asynchronous data.
- **When to Use:**

  - Systems with real-time data processing requirements.
  - Complex, distributed systems that need to react to events dynamically.

- **Example:**
  - A stock trading platform that reacts to market events or user actions.

### Benefits of Good System Architecture

- **Scalability**: Ability to scale both vertically and horizontally.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend the system over time.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handling system failures gracefully.
- **Security**: Building security features like encryption, authentication, and authorization.

## Key Considerations

- **Performance**: Choose an architecture that handles the expected load and response times.
- **Scalability**: Ensure that the architecture can grow with the application.
- **Technology Stack**: Align architecture with the technologies your team is comfortable with.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right system architecture is vital for building systems that are scalable, maintainable, and performant. It's important to analyze the problem domain and the expected growth of the application when choosing between monolithic, microservices, or other architectural patterns.
