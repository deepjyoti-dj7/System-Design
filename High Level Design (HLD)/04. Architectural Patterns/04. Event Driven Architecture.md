# üîî **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**

---

## üìñ 1. Definition

> **Event-Driven Architecture** is a software architecture paradigm promoting the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to **events** ‚Äî state changes or meaningful actions ‚Äî that decouple event producers from consumers.

- Enables **asynchronous**, loosely coupled communication.
- Systems react to events rather than relying on direct calls.
- Popular in distributed systems, IoT, real-time applications, and microservices.

| Concept              | Explanation                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event**            | A significant state change or occurrence in a system (e.g., ‚ÄúOrderPlaced‚Äù, ‚ÄúUserSignedUp‚Äù)      |
| **Event Producer**   | Component or service that generates events                                                      |
| **Event Consumer**   | Component or service that listens and reacts to events                                          |
| **Event Channel**    | Middleware or transport that carries events from producers to consumers (e.g., message brokers) |
| **Event Processing** | Logic applied when events are received                                                          |

| **Responsiveness** | Systems react quickly to state changes           |
| **Resilience**     | Failure isolated to components, retries possible |
| **Flexibility**    | New consumers added without changing producers   |

| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Ordering**         | Events may arrive out of order                             | Use partitioning, timestamps, sequence numbers |
| **Event Duplication**      | Events may be delivered multiple times                     | Idempotent consumers, deduplication logic      |
| **Event Schema Evolution** | Changes to event format must be backward compatible        | Versioning, schema registries (Avro, Protobuf) |
| **Complex Debugging**      | Distributed, asynchronous flow can be hard to trace        | Distributed tracing, correlation IDs           |
| **Data Consistency**       | Eventual consistency model introduces temporary divergence | Design for eventual consistency                |

## üß© 7. Event-Driven Patterns

| Pattern                                             | Description                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe)**                     | Producers publish to topics; consumers subscribe                    |
| **Event Sourcing**                                  | System state persisted as an immutable sequence of events           |
| **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** | Commands modify state, queries read from event store or projections |
| **Event Notification**                              | Simple alerts of events, no payload or minimal data                 |
| **Event-Carried State Transfer**                    | Events carry full state for synchronization                         |

## üîÑ 8. Event Flow Example

1. **User places an order** (Event Producer)
2. **Order service emits ‚ÄúOrderPlaced‚Äù event** to event broker
3. **Inventory service consumes ‚ÄúOrderPlaced‚Äù**, updates stock
4. **Shipping service consumes event**, prepares shipment
5. **Notification service sends order confirmation**

This decouples services; none call each other directly.
