# ‚ö° **Serverless Architecture**

---

## üìñ 1. Definition

> **Serverless Architecture** is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. Developers write code that runs in stateless compute containers triggered by events ‚Äî without managing servers themselves.

- The term ‚Äúserverless‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean **no servers**, but **no server management** by the user.
- Often implemented via **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)** platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions.
- Enables **event-driven**, highly scalable, pay-as-you-go execution.

## üß± 2. Core Characteristics

| Characteristic           | Explanation                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No Server Management** | Infrastructure provisioning and scaling is automatic                                    |
| **Event-driven**         | Functions triggered by HTTP requests, file uploads, DB changes, timers, etc.            |
| **Stateless**            | Functions are stateless and ephemeral; no in-memory state preserved between invocations |
| **Auto-scaling**         | Automatic scaling up/down based on number of events                                     |
| **Pay-per-use**          | Billed only for actual compute time and resources used                                  |

## üß¨ 3. Basic Architecture Model

```
[Client]
    ‚Üì HTTP/Event
[API Gateway or Event Source]
    ‚Üì triggers
[Serverless Function (Lambda)]
    ‚Üì accesses
[Databases, Storage, Other Services]
```

- Client or other cloud service triggers a function invocation.
- Function executes business logic and returns result.
- May interact with other services like databases, message queues, or storage.

- API Gateway enforces authentication and rate limiting
- Code should validate all inputs to avoid injection attacks
- Secrets management (environment variables, secret stores)

## üîÆ 14. When to Use Serverless?

- You want **rapid development and deployment** without managing infrastructure.
- Your workload is **event-driven** or has **variable, unpredictable traffic**.
- You want to **minimize costs** on idle compute resources.
- You have **stateless functions** or can externalize state.
- Your application can handle **cold start latency** or mitigate it.
