# üßÆ **Batch Processing vs üåä Stream Processing**

---

## üìñ 1. Definitions

### üßÆ Batch Processing

> A **data processing model** where data is collected over time, stored, and then **processed in chunks (batches)** at scheduled intervals.

- Involves **processing finite datasets**
- Introduces **latency** due to accumulation and scheduling
- Traditional ETL and data warehousing use this model

### üåä Stream Processing

> A **data processing model** that deals with **continuous flows of data** in **near real-time** or with **low latency**.

- Operates on **infinite, unbounded datasets**
- Designed for **low-latency** insights and actions
- Used in modern real-time systems (e.g., fraud detection, live analytics)

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Conceptual Model

| Attribute            | Batch Processing           | Stream Processing                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Data Input**       | Finite chunks              | Continuous, unbounded                 |
| **Processing Model** | Scheduled / Triggered jobs | Event-by-event / Micro-batch          |
| **Latency**          | High (minutes to hours)    | Low (milliseconds to seconds)         |
| **Complexity**       | Simpler to reason about    | Higher (event time, state, windowing) |
| **Typical Use Case** | Historical analytics, ETL  | Real-time monitoring, alerting        |

## üî¨ 4. Processing Characteristics

| Characteristic          | Batch                            | Stream                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Data Volume**         | High volume (e.g., days of data) | Continuous volume                 |
| **Event Ordering**      | Natural (static)                 | Must handle out-of-order events   |
| **State Management**    | Simple, often stateless          | Often stateful (e.g., aggregates) |
| **Failure Recovery**    | Re-run job                       | Checkpoints, reprocessing windows |
| **Data Time Semantics** | Processing time                  | Event time vs processing time     |

---

## üïí 5. Time Semantics in Stream Processing

- **Event Time**: When the event actually occurred
- **Processing Time**: When the event was observed
- **Windowing**: Aggregating events into time slices

üß† **Example**: Calculating per-minute sales requires tracking event timestamps, not when data was received.

## üí° 9. Design Considerations

### üìÅ Batch

- Best when **data completeness is more important** than freshness
- Ideal for **non-interactive systems**
- Supports **complex aggregations** that require global views

### üåä Stream

- Choose when **latency matters** (e.g., alerting, personalization)
- Requires handling:

  - **Out-of-order data**
  - **Backpressure**
  - **Stateful windows**

## üß† 11. Hybrid (Lambda & Kappa Architecture)

### Lambda Architecture (batch + speed layer)

- Batch layer: accuracy over time
- Speed layer: low latency view

```
[Input] --> [Batch layer: Hadoop] --> [Serving Layer]
        ‚Üò [Speed layer: Flink] ‚Üó
```

### Kappa Architecture (stream-first)

- Stream-first, **no batch**
- Reprocessing = re-running stream logic on stored events

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 12. Common Pitfalls

| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Data Skew**                 | Slows down reducers | Skews aggregation windows     |
| **Late Events**               | Not applicable      | Must handle with watermarking |
| **Backpressure**              | N/A                 | Must handle or system crashes |
| **Resource Overprovisioning** | Jobs run longer     | Always-on system, higher cost |
| **Debuggability**             | Logs + re-run       | Complex with async event flow |
