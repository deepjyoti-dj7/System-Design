# **REST vs RPC**

## 1. Introduction

In modern distributed systems, communication between services is critical to system design. Two dominant paradigms have emerged for enabling this communication: **REST (Representational State Transfer)** and **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**. Each approach provides a distinct method for structuring communication, with its own theoretical underpinnings, strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs.

This document offers an in-depth exploration of REST and RPC, analyzing their fundamental principles, design philosophies, performance implications, and ideal use cases. The goal is to provide architects, developers, and system designers with the conceptual clarity necessary to choose the appropriate communication mechanism.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1 What is REST?

**REST** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It was introduced by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation. REST is based on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- almost always HTTP.

#### Core Principles of REST:

- **Statelessness**: Each request from client to server must contain all information needed to understand and process the request.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Separation of concerns; the client is responsible for the user interface, and the server handles data storage and logic.
- **Cacheability**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to improve performance.
- **Uniform Interface**: A standardized method of communication, typically via HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Layered System**: The client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or to an intermediary.

### 2.2 What is RPC?

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** is a protocol that allows a program to execute a procedure (subroutine) on a different address space (commonly on another machine). RPC abstracts the communication mechanism, making remote calls appear as local function calls.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Encapsulation**: The client invokes a method without knowing implementation details.
- **Serialization (Marshalling)**: Converts method parameters into a transportable format.
- **Transport Layer**: Could be HTTP, TCP, or custom protocols.
- **Interface Definition Language (IDL)**: Defines the structure of methods and data types for communication.

RPC frameworks include gRPC (Google), Apache Thrift, and JSON-RPC.

## 3. REST vs RPC: Core Differences

| Feature             | REST                               | RPC                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

| Coupling            | Loosely coupled                    | Tightly coupled                   |

| Verb Usage          | Uses HTTP verbs                    | Uses method names                 |
| Caching             | Supported via HTTP cache semantics | Less straightforward              |
| Error Handling      | HTTP status codes                  | Custom codes or exceptions        |
| Learning Curve      | Lower                              | Higher                            |
| Performance         | May incur overhead due to HTTP     | Often more efficient (e.g., gRPC) |

## 4. REST: Deep Dive

### 4.1 RESTful Resources

REST focuses on resources (nouns) rather than actions (verbs). For example, `/users/123` represents a user resource, and `GET /users/123` retrieves it.

### 4.2 HTTP Verbs in REST

- `GET`: Retrieve data
- `POST`: Create data
- `PUT`: Replace data
- `PATCH`: Update data
- `DELETE`: Remove data

### 4.3 REST Constraints

REST is not just using HTTP with JSON; it's a set of constraints that guide API design:

- **Stateless interactions**
- **Clear URI naming schemes**
- **Standard HTTP status codes**

### 4.4 REST Advantages

- Simple and human-readable
- Widely adopted and supported
- Easily testable with tools like Postman or curl
- Browser-friendly

### 4.5 REST Limitations

- Overhead from HTTP headers
- Less efficient for high-throughput, low-latency use cases
- Often ignores HATEOAS, reducing its discoverability benefit

## 5. RPC: Deep Dive

### 5.1 Working Mechanism

In RPC, the client calls a method on a remote server as if it were a local method. The RPC framework takes care of:

- Marshalling parameters
- Communicating with the server
- Unmarshalling the response

### 5.2 Types of RPC

- **JSON-RPC**: Lightweight, uses JSON
- **XML-RPC**: Legacy systems, uses XML
- **gRPC**: High-performance, uses Protocol Buffers
- **Thrift**: Used by Facebook, highly customizable

### 5.3 RPC Advantages

- Efficient binary protocols (e.g., Protobuf in gRPC)
- Clear, strongly typed contracts (via IDL)
- Suitable for internal service-to-service communication
- Lower latency due to compact payloads

### 5.4 RPC Limitations

- Tighter coupling between client and server
- Less human-readable
- Requires additional tooling for debugging and testing
- Harder to support backwards compatibility

## 6. Theoretical Trade-Offs

### 6.1 Abstraction vs Transparency

REST exposes the structure and resources of the application more transparently. RPC hides the complexity, offering abstraction. The trade-off is between clarity and control vs convenience.

### 6.2 Performance vs Flexibility

RPC protocols like gRPC are optimized for speed but are less flexible for ad hoc querying or public APIs. REST, while slower, offers greater flexibility and extensibility.

### 6.3 Coupling vs Decoupling

RPC often leads to tighter coupling due to IDL contracts. REST encourages loose coupling, enabling independent evolution of clients and servers.

### 6.4 Developer Experience

REST's simplicity is better for human developers, especially for public APIs. RPC is more suited to internal microservices where performance is critical.

---

## 7. Use Cases and Suitability

### 7.1 When to Use REST

- Public APIs and third-party integrations
- Mobile and frontend-backend communication
- When human readability is important
- When caching and content negotiation matter

### 7.2 When to Use RPC

- Internal service-to-service communication
- Real-time or low-latency applications
- Streaming data (e.g., via gRPC streams)
- High-performance microservices

---

## 8. REST vs RPC in Microservices

In microservices architecture, choosing between REST and RPC can define communication patterns:

### REST in Microservices:

- Easier for heterogeneous systems
- More resilient to schema changes
- Works well with API gateways and service meshes

### RPC in Microservices:

- Preferred for performance-critical paths
- Supports synchronous and asynchronous modes
- Better type-safety and IDE integration

Some teams adopt a hybrid approach: REST for external APIs and RPC (e.g., gRPC) for internal communication.

## 9. Advanced Considerations

### 9.1 Security

- REST: OAuth2, TLS, API keys
- RPC: TLS, token-based auth; more complicated due to custom protocols

### 9.2 Tooling and Ecosystem

- REST: Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman, curl
- RPC: Protobuf compiler, gRPC tools, Thrift IDL

### 9.3 Monitoring and Observability

REST integrates easily with existing HTTP monitoring stacks. RPC may require custom instrumentation.

### 9.4 Versioning

- REST: URI or media-type versioning
- RPC: IDL versioning, backward/forward compatibility via Protobufs

---

## 10. REST vs RPC in the Cloud-Native World

### Kubernetes and Service Mesh

- gRPC integrates well with Envoy, Istio, and other service mesh tools.
- REST APIs can be managed with API gateways like Kong, Apigee, or AWS API Gateway.

### Serverless Architectures

- REST APIs fit naturally into serverless patterns like AWS Lambda + API Gateway.
- RPC is gaining traction via tools like AWS App Mesh and gRPC over Lambda (though more complex).

---

## 11. Future Trends

- **GraphQL**: A rising alternative to REST/RPC for frontend-backend interaction.
- **Hybrid APIs**: REST + gRPC combinations becoming common.
- **Protocol Agnosticism**: Tooling is evolving to support both REST and RPC under unified interfaces.

---

## 12. Conclusion

Both REST and RPC are powerful paradigms for building distributed systems. REST provides a more standardized, loosely coupled, and human-friendly interface, making it ideal for public APIs and less performance-critical services. In contrast, RPC offers tight integration, efficiency, and robust tooling that excels in high-performance, service-to-service communication within microservices.

Choosing between REST and RPC is not a question of right or wrong, but of context, requirements, and long-term maintainability. By understanding the underlying principles, strengths, and limitations of each approach, teams can make informed decisions that align with their architectural goals.
