## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Core Definitions

| Concept         | Definition                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrency** | Dealing with **multiple tasks at the same time**, but **not necessarily simultaneously**. The focus is on **task coordination**. |
| **Parallelism** | Performing **multiple tasks simultaneously**, usually across **multiple cores or processors**. Focus is on **execution**.        |

## üìå 2. High-Level Intuition

| Aspect            | Concurrency                        | Parallelism                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Focus             | **Managing many tasks**            | **Executing tasks simultaneously**   |
| Analogy           | A single chef managing many dishes | Many chefs each cooking a dish       |
| Hardware usage    | One core can be concurrent         | Multiple cores required for parallel |
| Execution pattern | Interleaved (time slicing)         | Truly simultaneous                   |
| Required skill    | Coordination, synchronization      | Decomposition, distribution          |

## üèóÔ∏è 3. Practical Example: Web Server

### Concurrency:

A single-threaded Node.js server can **handle thousands of requests** using async I/O and event loops ‚Äî only one thread, but **many active tasks**.

### Parallelism:

A Go or Java server using a **thread pool** or **multiple CPU cores** to process **multiple HTTP requests simultaneously**.

---

## üîç 4. Visual Metaphor

### Concurrency:

```
[Thread] --> Task A (pause) --> Task B (pause) --> Task A (resume) --> Task B (resume)
```

‚Üí Interleaving execution steps (like time-sharing)

### Parallelism:

```
[Core 1] --> Task A
[Core 2] --> Task B
```

‚Üí Truly simultaneous execution

## üß† 5. System Design Impact

### Concurrency:

- **Better resource utilization** (especially on I/O-heavy systems)
- Involves **context switching, locks, synchronization**
- Often involves **event loops, coroutines, async/await**

### Parallelism:

- Ideal for **CPU-bound workloads**
- Uses **multi-core CPUs, SIMD, GPU**
- Involves **multi-threading, multiprocessing**

## üßÆ 10. Concurrency Models (Conceptual)

### üßµ Thread-based Model

- Each task gets a dedicated thread
- Risk: thread explosion, context-switching overhead

### üìö Actor Model (e.g., Erlang, Akka)

- Tasks = actors
- Message-passing instead of shared memory

### üîÅ Event Loop Model (Node.js, Python asyncio)

- Single thread handles multiple I/O events asynchronously

### ‚ö° Reactive Streams

- Non-blocking, backpressure-aware pipelines
- Used in high-throughput event systems
