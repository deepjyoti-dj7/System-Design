# 🌐 **API Gateway – The Nervous System of Microservices**

---

## 📖 What is an API Gateway?

An **API Gateway** is a **single entry point** into a system that sits between clients (mobile/web apps) and backend services (like microservices, databases, or monoliths). It **receives API requests**, **routes them to the appropriate service**, **handles concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and response transformation**, and **returns the result** to the client.

Think of it as the **concierge** in a hotel: the client doesn't interact directly with each individual service — it interacts with the gateway, which knows **how to reach the right room (service)** and perform additional value-added tasks on the way.

---

## 💡 Why Do We Need API Gateways?

### 🔹 In Monolithic Apps:

Everything is in one place. Clients directly talk to a server. No gateway needed.

### 🔹 In Microservices:

With dozens or hundreds of services, direct communication becomes:

- **Too complex**: Each client must know which service does what.
- **Inconsistent**: Auth, logging, and rate limiting need to be duplicated.
- **Hard to secure**: Every service has to handle threats.

→ Hence, we introduce an **API Gateway** as the **front controller** pattern for all API requests.

## 🧠 Core Responsibilities of an API Gateway (Expanded)

| Responsibility                        | Detailed Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing**                           | One of the primary functions. Based on URI paths, HTTP methods, headers, or other request attributes, the gateway forwards the request to the appropriate backend service. Routing logic can be static (based on config) or dynamic (via service discovery). This enables clean decoupling between frontend and backend service endpoints.     |
| **Authentication & Authorization**    | API Gateways can validate incoming requests via OAuth 2.0 tokens, API keys, HMAC signatures, or JWTs before they reach backend services. It offloads identity verification from individual services, standardizing security enforcement at the edge. Authorization policies (e.g., role-based or scope-based access) can also be applied here. |
| **Rate Limiting / Throttling**        | Prevents abuse and DoS attacks by limiting how often a client can call an API within a time window (e.g., 100 requests/minute per IP). Rate limits can be defined per user, per IP, or per endpoint. Throttling can delay or reject excess requests. This protects backend services from overload.                                             |
| **Aggregation / Composition**         | For composite frontends (like dashboards), the gateway can make multiple internal API calls to different services (e.g., /user, /notifications, /orders), then combine the results into a single response to the client. This reduces the number of round-trips from the client and simplifies frontend logic.                                 |
| **Protocol Translation**              | API Gateways can convert between different transport or serialization protocols: e.g., HTTP REST to gRPC, WebSocket to HTTP, XML to JSON. This is useful when clients and services evolve independently, or when modern frontends need to talk to legacy backends.                                                                             |
| **Caching**                           | Gateways can cache frequently accessed GET responses, reducing the load on backend services and improving latency. Caching is typically short-lived and key-based, and can be used for both static and dynamic content (with care).                                                                                                            |
| **Retries & Circuit Breaking**        | The gateway can implement resilience strategies: retrying failed requests with exponential backoff, or cutting off traffic to failing services temporarily (circuit breaker pattern) to prevent cascading failures.                                                                                                                            |
| **Monitoring & Logging**              | Since all requests pass through the gateway, it's the perfect place to centralize **metrics**, **access logs**, and **distributed traces**. This gives full visibility into API usage patterns, failures, and performance bottlenecks. Tools like Prometheus, Datadog, and ELK Stack are commonly integrated.                                  |
| **Security Controls**                 | The gateway enforces TLS/SSL, applies IP whitelisting/blacklisting, validates headers, detects anomalies, and integrates with WAFs (Web Application Firewalls). It acts as the first line of defense for public-facing APIs.                                                                                                                   |
| **Request & Response Transformation** | The gateway can manipulate requests or responses: e.g., adding/removing headers, transforming request bodies, redacting sensitive fields, or compressing large responses. This is often used when frontend requirements differ from backend contracts.                                                                                         |
| **Service Discovery Integration**     | In dynamic environments (like Kubernetes), gateways integrate with service discovery tools (e.g., Consul, etcd, DNS) to dynamically resolve where to route requests. This avoids hardcoded IPs or manual config updates.                                                                                                                       |
| **Cross-Cutting Policy Management**   | API Gateways allow organizations to enforce consistent policies (e.g., quotas, SLAs, billing, data access control) across all services in one place. This is essential in regulated or enterprise-grade systems.                                                                                                                               |

## ⚙️ Design Patterns with API Gateways

### 1. **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)**

Each client type (mobile, web, IoT) has a specialized gateway that tailors the API and response formatting to their needs.

- ✅ Optimized UX per device.
- ⚠️ Requires managing multiple gateways.

**Example**:
Netflix has different API Gateways for iOS, Android, and TV apps.

---

### 2. **Service Mesh + API Gateway**

API Gateway handles **north-south traffic** (external ↔ system), while the **Service Mesh** (e.g., Istio) handles **east-west traffic** (service ↔ service).

- ✅ Better separation of concerns.
- ✅ Better observability and reliability.

---

### 3. **Edge Gateway + Internal Gateways**

Use a public-facing **edge gateway** for traffic from the internet, and **internal API gateways** for service-to-service routing.

---

## 🧰 Examples of API Gateways in Production

| Company | Gateway Tool            | Key Use Case                                |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Netflix | **Zuul (now replaced)** | BFF pattern + authentication                |
| Amazon  | **Amazon API Gateway**  | API proxy for microservices & Lambda        |
| Spotify | **Custom Kong / NGINX** | Service discovery + response transformation |
| Airbnb  | **Envoy**               | Load balancing + observability              |
| Shopify | **Kong**                | Handles rate limiting, circuit breakers     |

---

## 🧪 Code Snippets

### Example: Kong Declarative Config (YAML)

```yaml
services:
  - name: users-service
    url: http://users.internal:8080
    routes:
      - name: users-route
        paths:
          - /api/v1/users

plugins:
  - name: rate-limiting
    config:
      minute: 100
      policy: local
```

This config defines a route and limits incoming requests to 100/minute.

---

### Example: Express.js Acting as Basic Gateway

```js
const express = require("express");
const proxy = require("http-proxy-middleware");

const app = express();

app.use("/users", proxy({ target: "http://localhost:5001" }));
app.use("/orders", proxy({ target: "http://localhost:5002" }));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("API Gateway running on 3000"));
```

Very basic, but shows how routing works.
