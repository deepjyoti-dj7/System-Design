# üìö **Database Indexes**

## üß≠ 1. Introduction

Databases are at the heart of nearly every modern application. As the volume of data grows, the speed and efficiency of retrieving relevant information become critical to application performance. **Database indexing** is one of the most fundamental and powerful techniques for optimizing query performance.

This document presents a comprehensive and theory-heavy exploration of database indexing, including its principles, types, internal workings, design considerations, and best practices. We will cover the why, what, and how of indexing across multiple database systems (relational and NoSQL) to give you a deep understanding of how to build performant data access layers.

## üîç 2. What is an Index in a Database?

An **index** is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional space and slower write operations. Think of it like the index at the back of a book ‚Äî instead of reading the entire book to find a topic, you look up the keyword in the index to get the exact page number.

### Why Indexing Matters

- **Improved Read Performance**: Reduces the number of disk reads required to satisfy a query.
- **Efficient Search**: Especially beneficial for large datasets.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Speeds up ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and WHERE clause operations.
- **Uniqueness and Constraints**: Enforces data integrity.

However, indexes are not free:

- **Write Overhead**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations become slower.
- **Storage Cost**: Indexes consume additional disk space.

## üß† 3. How Indexes Work Internally

### 3.1 Index Structure

Most database indexes use data structures like:

- **B-Trees (Balanced Trees)**: Used in most relational databases.
- **Hash Tables**: Used for equality comparisons.
- **Bitmaps**: Useful for low-cardinality columns.
- **Inverted Indexes**: Common in full-text search.

### 3.2 B-Tree Index (Most Common)

- **Self-balancing tree** data structure.
- Keeps data sorted and allows binary searches.
- Operations are logarithmic in complexity (O(log n)).

**Structure:**

- **Root Node**: Entry point.
- **Internal Nodes**: Guide the search.
- **Leaf Nodes**: Contain the actual data pointers.

### 3.3 Index Lookup

When a query runs:

1. The optimizer checks if any indexes are usable.
2. If an index exists for the column in the WHERE clause, it is used to find row pointers.
3. The corresponding rows are retrieved from the table (called the **table lookup** or **row fetch**).

---

## üß± 4. Types of Indexes

### 4.1 Single-Column Index

- Built on one column.
- Suitable for queries filtering or sorting on that column only.

### 4.2 Composite (Multi-Column) Index

- Covers multiple columns.
- Most useful when columns in the WHERE clause match the **prefix** of the index.

Example: Index on `(col1, col2, col3)`

- Efficient for WHERE clauses like `WHERE col1 = ?`, `WHERE col1 = ? AND col2 = ?`.

### 4.3 Unique Index

- Ensures all values in the index are distinct.
- Often used to enforce primary keys and unique constraints.

### 4.4 Full-Text Index

- Designed for text search.
- Supports features like stemming, stop words, ranking.
- Common in search engines or blogs.

### 4.5 Spatial Index

- Used for geospatial queries.
- Based on R-trees or QuadTrees.

### 4.6 Bitmap Index

- Maps bitmaps to unique column values.
- Best for columns with a small number of distinct values (low cardinality).
- Often used in data warehousing.

### 4.7 Covering Index

- Includes all the columns a query needs.
- Avoids accessing the actual table (index-only scan).

---

## üß™ 5. Indexing Strategies and Theoretical Concepts

### 5.1 Selectivity

- Ratio of matching rows to total rows.
- **High selectivity** (fewer matching rows) = good for indexing.

### 5.2 Cardinality

- Number of distinct values in a column.
- High-cardinality columns (e.g., IDs) make good index candidates.
- Low-cardinality columns (e.g., Boolean) typically don't.

### 5.3 Index Scan vs. Table Scan

- **Index Scan**: Traverses the index tree to find rows.
- **Table Scan**: Scans the entire table.
- Optimizer decides which based on cost.

### 5.4 Index Depth and Fanout

- Index depth = number of tree levels.
- Fanout = number of child nodes per node.
- Low depth = faster lookups.

### 5.5 Covering Index

- All data is in the index.
- No need to fetch rows from the table.

## üß∞ 6. Index Design Patterns

### 6.1 Index Only What You Query

Don't blindly index every column. Index columns that appear in:

- WHERE clause
- JOIN conditions
- ORDER BY / GROUP BY

### 6.2 Compound Indexes for AND Conditions

When a query filters on multiple columns, a compound index improves performance:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ? AND order_date = ?
```

Should be supported by index: `(customer_id, order_date)`

### 6.3 Separate Indexes for OR Conditions

For:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? OR phone = ?
```

Separate indexes on `email` and `phone` are better.

### 6.4 Index for Sorting

If your query uses ORDER BY, the index can be used to return sorted data without an extra sort step.

### 6.5 Partial Indexes

Only index rows that meet a condition:

```sql
CREATE INDEX active_users_idx ON users(last_login) WHERE active = true;
```

### 6.6 Functional Indexes

Index based on a function of a column:

```sql
CREATE INDEX lower_email_idx ON users(LOWER(email));
```

## üìâ 7. Costs and Trade-offs

### 7.1 Write Overhead

Every write operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) must update the index.

### 7.2 Storage Cost

Each index consumes disk space.

### 7.3 Maintenance Overhead

Indexes must be maintained to stay accurate. Poorly maintained indexes degrade performance.

## üåç 9. Indexing in NoSQL Databases

### 9.1 MongoDB

- Uses B-tree for single field and compound indexes
- Supports TTL indexes
- Indexes on array fields (multikey)

### 9.2 Cassandra

- Primary index on partition key
- Secondary indexes are discouraged for large datasets
- Best to use materialized views or custom denormalization

### 9.3 Elasticsearch

- Optimized for full-text and analytical search
- Segment merging affects performance

## üßÆ 10. Query Optimization and Indexing

### 10.1 Query Plans

- Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand index usage
- Ensure index usage aligns with query structure

### 10.2 Index Hints

Sometimes the optimizer needs help:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users USE INDEX(name_idx) WHERE name = 'Alice';
```

### 10.3 Covering Queries

Design indexes that cover frequently executed queries to avoid table access altogether.

---

## üèó 11. Best Practices

1. **Index selectively**: Not every column needs an index.
2. **Monitor and audit usage**: Remove unused indexes.
3. **Avoid redundant indexes**: Overlapping indexes add overhead.
4. **Align indexes with workload**: Analyze query logs.
5. **Rebuild or reorg indexes periodically**: Especially for write-heavy systems.
6. **Use index advisor tools**: Provided by DBMS vendors.
7. **Test before production**: Evaluate performance impacts.

## üìä 12. Case Studies and Scenarios

### Scenario 1: E-commerce Search

- Use full-text indexes for product descriptions.
- Use compound indexes on category + price.

### Scenario 2: Social Media Platform

- Index user IDs for fast profile lookups.
- Use partial indexes on active sessions.

### Scenario 3: Analytics Dashboard

- Use columnstore indexes for aggregation queries.
- Avoid indexes on real-time inserts.

## ‚úÖ 13. Conclusion

Indexes are a cornerstone of efficient database design. By understanding their internal workings, types, trade-offs, and strategic applications, developers and architects can build systems that are not only performant but also scalable and maintainable.

Whether you're designing for OLTP, OLAP, or a hybrid system, thoughtful index design can make the difference between a responsive application and a sluggish one. Use them wisely, test thoroughly, and never stop monitoring ‚Äî because data never stops growing.
