# üèõÔ∏è **Database Architectures**

## üìå 1. Introduction

Modern applications rely heavily on efficient data storage, retrieval, and processing mechanisms. The underlying **database architecture** directly impacts scalability, performance, maintainability, and resilience. Database architecture encompasses the design, structure, and rules governing how data is stored, accessed, and managed within a database system. It includes choices around storage engines, query optimization, distribution, replication, concurrency control, and more.

This document explores core concepts and theoretical foundations of database architectures, from classical models to modern distributed systems. It offers a deep dive into the principles that guide design decisions and analyzes trade-offs in architecture patterns.

## üß± 2. What Is Database Architecture?

**Database architecture** is the framework that defines how databases are structured, organized, and operated. It involves physical and logical aspects of database systems, including:

- **Data models**
- **Storage layers**
- **Access and processing mechanisms**
- **Concurrency and transaction control**
- **Distribution and scalability models**
- **System topology (single-node vs. multi-node)**

Architecture decisions affect not just the internal working of databases, but also the design of dependent applications.

## üîÑ 3. Architectural Models

### 3.1 Single-Tier Architecture

- Also called **monolithic** or embedded databases (e.g., SQLite)
- Application and database reside on the same node
- Minimal latency, low complexity
- Poor scalability and concurrency

### 3.2 Two-Tier Architecture

- Traditional **client-server** model
- Database engine is separate from application logic
- Good for small-to-medium applications
- Network latency can be a factor

### 3.3 Three-Tier Architecture

- Adds a **middle-tier**: application server or API layer
- Enables business logic abstraction and scalability
- Common in enterprise web applications

### 3.4 n-Tier / Multi-Tier Architectures

- Used in microservices and service-oriented architectures
- Supports modular, decoupled components
- Increases system complexity but allows independent scaling and upgrades

## üìä 4. Types of Databases by Architecture

### 4.1 Relational Databases (RDBMS)

- Based on **set theory and relational algebra**
- Uses **ACID** properties for transaction safety
- Well-suited for structured data
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle

### 4.2 NoSQL Databases

- Designed for **scalability, flexibility, and performance**
- Includes document, key-value, column-family, and graph stores
- Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j

### 4.3 NewSQL Databases

- Combine the **relational model** with **horizontal scalability**
- Support strong consistency and distributed ACID transactions
- Examples: Google Spanner, CockroachDB, TiDB

## üìê 5. Data Modeling and Schema Design

### 5.1 Logical vs. Physical Models

- **Logical model**: abstract, independent of implementation
- **Physical model**: reflects actual data storage and indexing

### 5.2 Normalization

- Based on **functional dependency theory**
- Reduces data redundancy via normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.)

### 5.3 Denormalization

- Improves **read performance** by introducing redundancy
- Used in OLAP, NoSQL, and reporting systems

### 5.4 Schema-Less Designs

- Adopted in NoSQL systems
- Allows dynamic, flexible data models
- Requires careful governance to avoid data chaos

## üö¶ 6. Transaction and Concurrency Architecture

### 6.1 ACID Properties

- **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability**
- Ensures correctness of concurrent transactions

### 6.2 Concurrency Control Mechanisms

- **Pessimistic Locking**: locks data during transaction
- **Optimistic Locking**: uses versioning or timestamps
- **MVCC** (Multi-Version Concurrency Control): enables high throughput

### 6.3 Isolation Levels

- **Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable**
- Govern how transaction changes become visible

## ‚öôÔ∏è 7. Storage and Indexing Architectures

### 7.1 Storage Engines

- **Row-based**: good for OLTP
- **Column-based**: good for OLAP
- Examples: InnoDB, RocksDB, LSM Trees

### 7.2 Index Types

- **B-tree**, **Hash Index**, **GIN/GiST** for advanced indexing
- Inverted indexes for text search

### 7.3 Write Path Optimization

- **Write-ahead logging**
- **Data buffering**
- **Log-structured merge trees (LSM)**

## üèÅ 17. Conclusion

Database architecture forms the bedrock of modern data-driven applications. From single-node embedded databases to globally distributed, replicated clusters, the choice of architecture impacts nearly every aspect of a system‚Äôs functionality. Understanding the theories‚Äîlike CAP, MVCC, and relational algebra‚Äîalongside practical concerns‚Äîlike replication, sharding, and access control‚Äîis crucial to building performant, resilient, and maintainable systems.

Database architecture is not static. It evolves with business needs, technological innovation, and application scale. An architect‚Äôs job is to constantly evaluate trade-offs, anticipate bottlenecks, and select appropriate patterns. The right architecture, properly implemented, ensures that databases not only store data but also serve as reliable, scalable foundations for modern applications.
